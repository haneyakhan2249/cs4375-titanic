Analytics done using scikit-learn (Python).


Methods:
- decision tree (DecisionTreeClassifier)
- neural networks (MLPClassifier)
- gradient boosting (XGBoost)


Implementation:
Each method is impemented in two files: Python file and Jupyter Notebook. The code itself is the same, 
but just provides two different means of running the code. (We did this because we display an ROC curve and 
sometimes it doesn't display properly when running the python file).



HOW TO RUN:

- prerequistites:
    - scikit-learn
    - XGBoost
    - Jupyter Notebooks if running notebooks

- to run python files
    - decision tree: `python dec_tree.py`
    - neural network: `python neural_net.py`
    - gradient boosting: `python xg_boost.py`

- to run jupyter notebooks
    - for all three, simply open and use the 'Run' button
